<h1>Hello Ynot!</h1>
<h2>
  So since sending the file by Email didn't work. I came up with a crazy idea to
  create a website just for you guys
</h2>

<h3>Instrutions</h3>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Click the link down below to download the file</li>
  <li>
    You will be directed to a media fire site to download. Just click the button
    and your'e good to go
  </li>
  <img src="./images/step2.png" alt="media-fire-website" height="250" />
</ol>

<a
  href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/ub9m0jy370lpuxm/Ynot_dinner_ticket_-_front_and_back.psd/file"
  >Download the PSD file</a
>

<p>
  Thank you Ynot! (Comfort) <br />
  I Sincerly hope it was of any help
</p>
